# Covid 19 Data Analysis Project

Repository containing a Covid 19 Data Analysis project completed for my own self-interest in the deaths and vaccinations cases from March 2022. For the completion of this project, I have used my skills in excel for data wrangling and SQL to perform an exploratory data analysis.<br />

The covid 19 data used for the analysis was downloaded from the World in Data [website](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths). I have also attached a copy of the used dataset.<br />

There are two SQL scripts files with an exploratory data analysis of the Covid 19 dataset from March 2022.<br />

The first one was completed to perform a Data Visualization on Tableau Public. You can check this work on my Tableau Public Page [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/felipe.nery.da.silva/viz/Covid19DashboardMarch2022/Dashboard1).<br />

The second, contains an exploratory data analysis and the stored SQL views to perform visualizations on any data visual tool.<br />
 
Please, feel free to use any of my codes or scripts and make a comment on my work.
