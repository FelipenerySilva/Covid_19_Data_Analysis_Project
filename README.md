# Covid 19 Data Analysis Project for SQL and Tableau

Repository containing a Covid 19 Data Analysis project completed for my own self-interest in the deaths and vaccinations cases. For the completion of this project, I have used my skills in excel for data wrangling, SQL to perform an exploratory data analysis and Tableau to create a datavisualization in a dashboard.<br />

The covid 19 data used for the analysis was downloaded from the World in Data [website](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths). The used data set file is fairly big and I could not upload to this repository. In case of interest the file contained 169,940 rows of covid 19 data from March/2020 to March/2022.<br />

There are two SQL scripts files with an exploratory data analysis of the Covid 19 dataset:<br />

*The first one was completed to perform a Data Visualization on Tableau Public. You can check this work on my Tableau Public Page [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/felipe.nery.da.silva/viz/Covid19DashboardMarch2022/Dashboard1).<br />

*The second, contains an exploratory data analysis and the stored SQL views to create a data lake or to perform visualizations on Tableu Desktop or Power BI.<br />
 
Please, feel free to use any of my codes or scripts and make a comment on my work.
